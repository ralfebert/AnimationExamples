* can SwiftUI modifiers be applied to SVGView shape nodes programmatically? (f.e. shadow, or animated modifiers)
* SVGShaper: get relative coordinates in inner shapes? (maybe using SVG tools?)
* why does a affine transform to scale by y = -1 does not flip the mouth?
* Animate transformEffect (flip/rotate) in SwiftUI didn't work out of the box
* Rive example needed Default Actor Isolation disabled, proper way to handle that?
